Description: Pivotal API client library
        ==========================
        
        Simple example
        --------------
        
        If you don't have a token, get one using username and password (or
        just pass it directly):
        
          >>> client = PivotalClient(token=None, cache='path/to/cache')
          >>> token = client.token.active('username', 'password')['token']['guid']
        
          >>> client.token = token
        
        Get some projects:
        
          >>> projects = client.projects.all()['projects']
        
        Get current stories for a project:
        
          >>> iterations = client.iterations.current(projects[0]['id'])
        
          >>> storries_in_current_iteration = iterations[0]['iteration']['stories']
        
        This should probably be client.projects.iterations.current(), but using
        flat structure at the moment.
